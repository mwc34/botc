Show 3 character tokens of arbitrary Good characters. If the token received by the Lunatic is a Demon that would wake tonight: \u2022 Allow the Lunatic to do the Demon actions. Place their \u201cattack\u201d markers. Wake the Demon. Show the Demon\u2019s real character token. Show them the Lunatic player. \u2022 If the Lunatic attacked players: Show the real demon each marked player. Remove any Lunatic \u201cattack\u201d markers.",
